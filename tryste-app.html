              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>
                I created a responsive web exercise app. The apps goal is "to ignite a love for fitness" by helping users
                build a solid foundation through easy-to-follow workout videos and instructions.
              </p>

          <div class="portfolio-description">
          <h2>Design Process</h2>
          <p>
            I started the inspiration phase of my process by conducting market research and competitor analysis
            to better understand who my competitors were and what they did well or poorly.
          </p>

          <h2>Problem Statement & solution</h2>
          <p>
           My findings revealed that  despite there being so many dating apps, there
           wasnt an applicaation that met some of the needs that my application would.
           This meant that the potential for Tryste was huge. However, it was also a big 
           risk (Why wasnt there an app with such features already?)

           I sought to overcome this risk by seizing the opportunity and creating an 
           app users didnt know they needed.
          </p>

          <p>
              My findings also helped me hsape my problem statement and possible solutions.
              my original problem statement has remained consistent throughout the apps
              development, through the solutions have changed slightly as ive progressed.
          </p>

        <div class="portfolio-description">
          <h2>User Interviews</h2>
          <p>
           I conducted user interviews remotely to gain understaning of my users' needs, goals, and points of friction.
           I asked questions focused on users experiences with dating apps. I then analyzedmy usersanswers by sorting them
           into an affinity map to gain overraching insights.
          </p>
          <p>
              The user research helped confirm or revise my possible solutions and user stories.
              From there, I decided to create the app with the following main functions:
          </p>

        <div class="portfolio-description">
          <h2>Conceptualization</h2>
          <p>
          Used findings from inspiration phase to create two user personas to represent users with 
          different backgrounds and needs.
          </p>

      <div class="portfolio-description">
        <h2>Site Map</h2>
        <p>
         I then created a site map to organize the structure of my app and have
         a visual represention of the screens and how they relate to each other.
         I used open card sort with 5 participants.

        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>
          I then started sketching low-fidelity wireframes with pen and paper.
          I moved on to adobe XD for mid and high-fidelity wireframes. throughout
          the different fidelity stages, continous iterations were made to improve the apps unctionality
          and UX.

        <h2>Iteration</h2>
        <p>
        During the first phase of the iteraion phase, I used Figma to create
        a clickable prototype.

        <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
        <p>
        I prepared for usability testing by creating a test plan and test script
        to ensure an easy and smooth testing experience for my participants. I conducted moderated remote
        usability tests and was able to gain alot of valuable insights.Using my findings from the tests
        i created an affinity map top analyze the results and a rainbow spreadsheet to map
        out and prioritize the errors that occured during testing.
        </p>

        <h5>Usability Research Test Plan</h5>
        <p>
         Ask the users to navigate to the following pages on the prototype:
         <ul>
           <li>Home Page</li>
           <li>Matches</li>
           <li>Messages</li>
           <li>Settings</li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Ask the users to complete to the following pages on the prototype:
          <ul>
            <li>Start a conversation</li>
            <li>Attempt lodging a complaint</li>
            <li>Edit profile after completing it</li>
            <li>Create Account</li>
          </ul>

      </div>
      


    <div class="portfolio-description">
        <h2>Style Guide</h2>
        <p>
            I used real images and pops of color to engage users and get them excited about dating new people.
             I wanted the images to be aspirational, yet approachable, to show users possibilities that were attainable. 
             The images also showcased people of variey of background and color to ensure that the app was appealing 
             to different users' preference.
        </p>

        <h2>Colors</h2>
        <p>
            The app's main colors were Red,orange,white and greys. The red hues draws attention
            to the user and radiates a strong and powerful energy that motivates a user to take action.
            It is linked to sexuality and stimulates deep and intimate passion, which makes it ideal for the app.

            The minimal orange hues is said to evoke happinness,warmth,joy and expression.
            White and grey. The grey hues used in texts of the app, is done so for legibility, so much so that
            it isnt too bold, creating a distraction but is subtle enough for users to be able to read texts.

            The color white adds simplicity and coolness to the overall look and feel of the application.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/img/portfolio/colorscheme.jpg" alt="">

        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>
        For Typography, I used San serif to ensure legibility.
        </p>

      </div>
      

    <div class="portfolio-description">
        <h2>Icons</h2>
        <p>
        I used clean and simple icons, and for the most part i used universal icons.
        There were cases where the icons function, might not be obvious at first glance
        (e.g the premium and about us icons). However, with the added text, the user will
        learn what they mean.

      <div class="portfolio-description">
        <h2>Final reflections</h2>
        <p>
        Even though I was more drawn to creating wireframes and prototpyes, I found that
        the most important part of the process was <strong>testing</strong>.
        Usability testing was crucuial in finding errors and seeing things from a diferent perspective
        . The biggest error occured was a lack of onbaording process which made it harder
         to complete tasks. In my next Iteration, i will add the onboarding to
         strike a balance between what my participants want and what they need.
        </p>

        <p>
            I also conducted a preference test to see which version of Logo and color they
            preferred. All of them preferred the alternate version. This was a great reminder to put my 
            personal taste aside and keep my users front and center.
        </p>

        <p>
            Constructive critisim was also an important part of the process. Asking my UX peers
            gave me ideas on ways to improve the app in future iterations.
        </p>

        <p>
            I would also like to increase the accesibility of the app, especially outside of my region.
            Initially, my app was geared towards anyone within Kenyan and its borders. This means that the app may not
            be fully catered for use in oversee countries.
